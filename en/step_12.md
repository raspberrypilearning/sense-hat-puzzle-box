## Convert orientation to an angle

The Sense HAT measures orientation along three axes: x, y, and z. We want to turn these measurements into a simple rotation angle using the `x` and `y` data. When stationary, the Sense HAT will record a measurement of 1â€‰**G** (G = acceleration due to gravity) straight down, and this can be used to calculate which way up it is.

The table below shows how the G measurements along the `x` and `y` axes relate to four rotation angles.

|  0 degrees | 90 degrees  | 180 degrees | 270 degrees |
| - | - | - | - |
| ![0 degrees rotation](images/sense0.png) | ![90 degrees rotation](images/sense90.png) | ![180 degrees rotation](images/sense180.png) | ![270 degrees rotation](images/sense270.png) |
| **x = 0** | **x = -1** | **x = 0** | **x = 1** |
| **y = 1** | **y = 0** | **y = -1** | **y = 0** |


As your lock program is going to need to calculate the rotation angle using the **G** measurement over and over again, you should first create a function to perform this calculation.

[[[generic-python-simple-functions]]]

This function will need values of `x` and `y` as inputs, and will return the rotation angle as an output.

+ In the **Functions** section, define a function called `get_angle(x,y)`.

+ Inside the function, round the values of `x` and `y` to zero decimal places using the `round` function.

[[[generic-python-rounding-numbers]]]

+ Create an `if` statement to return the correct angle from the table above. For example, you might start off like this to represent the first angle (0&deg;) in the table:

```python
if x == 0 and y == 1:
    return 0
```

Continue to add more conditions to your statement using `elif` to check for the other three angles in the table.

Here is how your finished code should look:

```python
##### Functions #####
def get_angle(x,y):
  x = round(x, 0)       
  y = round(y, 0)

  if x == 0 and y == 1:
      return 0
  elif x == -1 and y == 0:
      return 90
  elif x == 0 and y == -1:
      return 180
  elif x == 1 and y == 0:
      return 270
```
