## Temperature lock

I n order to open this lock, the user will need to raise or lower the temperature the Sense HAT's temperature sensor measure by a number of degrees.

### How will the lock work?

You will do the following to set up this lock:

- Choose a target temperature close to the current temperature
- Display a colour clue as to whether the Sense HAT is too cold or too hot compared to the target temperature
- Continually check the current temperature against the target temperature
- When the target temperature is reached, display the `unlocked` graphic

The list above is called an **algorithm** â€” a set of instructions which describe the program you're going to write.
