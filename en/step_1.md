## Introduction

Create an electronic puzzle box using a Raspberry Pi and a Sense HAT. The user will have to solve a series of puzzle steps in order to "open" the box.

Puzzle boxes have been used for centuries to hide secret items or information. Many people still make them today for their entertainment value.
