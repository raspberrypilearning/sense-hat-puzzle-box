## Locked or not?

It would be helpful to show the user some feedback as to whether the box is locked or not. To do this, you're first going to use a pair of padlock images: one red locked padlock and one green unlocked one.

+ In the **Pixel art** section, create four variables called `r`, `g`, `w`, and `b`. These should store the colours red, green, white, and black/blank in RGB format. For example, your `r` variable should look like this:

```python
r = (255, 0, 0)
```

+ Next, create two different lists of 64 items, one to represent the locked padlock and the other to represent the open padlock.

Create two lists, each containing 64 items, to represent the padlock images the LED matrix will display. Each item in the lists should be the name of one of the colour variables you just created. For example, to place a blank pixel in the top left corner of the LED matrix, the first item in the list should be `b`.

Here is how your code should look:

```python

locked = [
    b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b,
    b, b, b, w, w, b, b, b,
    b, b, w, b, b, w, b, b,
    b, b, w, b, b, w, b, b,
    b, b, r, r, r, r, b, b,
    b, b, r, r, r, r, b, b,
    b, b, r, r, r, r, b, b,
    b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b
]

unlocked = [
    b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b,
    b, b, b, b, b, w, w, b,
    b, b, b, b, w, b, b, w,
    b, b, b, b, w, b, b, w,
    b, b, g, g, g, g, b, b,
    b, b, g, g, g, g, b, b,
    b, b, g, g, g, g, b, b,
    b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b
]
```

+ Go to the **Main program** section to add some code to test your images. The new code should display the `locked` image on the LED matrix, then wait two seconds, then display the `unlocked` image and wait for another two seconds.

Use the `set_pixels` method to display a list of pixels on the LED matrix.

--- /hint ---

--- hint ---
Use the `sleep` method to ask the program to wait. For example, `sleep(1)` will make it wait for one second. You can change the number in the brackets to change how long the program waits.
--- /hint ---

--- hint ---
Here is how the code should look:

```python
sense.set_pixels(locked)
sleep(2)
sense.set_pixels(unlocked)
sleep(2)
```

Now that your basic code is ready, it's time to add some locks to protect your secret message. These locks can be added in any order, and it's up to you to choose which ones you will add.
